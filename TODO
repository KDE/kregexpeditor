TODO:
-----
- undo/redo in right mouse click menu.

Later wishes:
-------------
- Make the KMultiFormListBox widget support that a line can show several entries.
  Use this feature to show two CharSelectors on one line for selecting a single char
  in the CharacterWidget.
- Cleanup in the use of repaint(). Several of the repaint() can be update() instead.
- add a checker widget, which can show what the regexp matches from a user defined text.
- add the posibility to travers the widget using the keyboard.
- Highlight the dragaccepter on dragEnter

Back references
---------------
- when deleting a compound widget, which has a backreference, what should be done with the
  back reference?
- cut/past should preserve back reference id, while cut/copy should create
  a new one.
- create interface for extracting information about back references.

- support back references in the regexp: "(abc|def)\1"
